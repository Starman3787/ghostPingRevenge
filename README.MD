# Ghostping Revenge

## Get revenge on those pesky ghostpingers by ghostpinging them back!

[![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/750062513038557274.svg)](https://top.gg/bot/750062513038557274)

Check out the bot [on top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/750062513038557274) or even host it yourself!

### To Host It Yourself

- Navigate to the folder you want to download the bot to
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Starman3787/ghostPingRevenge` in the command prompt
- In the folder that contains **bot.js**, create a file called **config.env**
- In the **config.env** file, add `TOKEN=[replace this with a Discord bot token]`. A bot token can be obtained by [creating a bot application](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
- Invite the bot to your server. You can generate an invite for your bot [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)
- Run `npm start` into the command prompt, and you should see the bot come online!

> **Note**: Your computer must be switched on for the bot to stay online! If this is all too complex for you, you can always add [the bot which we host ourselves](https://top.gg/bot/750062513038557274).
